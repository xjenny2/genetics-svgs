# genetics-svgs
File dump of everything I've completed in the summer of 2018.  Most are variations of the files found in genetics_svgs_final that were made redundant by later improvements, or else were too specific for automation to be practical.  Since many of these files use functions from the master files (functionsclinvar, functionsgnomad, and shapes) but were never revisited and updated to match the most recent versions of those functions, they may not work properly or at all.

## clinvar_col6A1ccrs.py IS updated and working!
This file was revisited and edited to ensure that there's at least one working copy of the ccrs code.
