# genetics-svgs
File dump of everything I've completed in the summer of 2018.  Most are variations of the files found in genetics_svgs_final with additional features like ccrs percentile boxes.  Many might not work due to later changes made to the master functions files (functionsclinvar, functionsgnomad and shapes) as I worked.
## clinvar_col6A1ccrs.py IS confirmed to work!
This is so that there's at least one working copy of the ccrs code...
